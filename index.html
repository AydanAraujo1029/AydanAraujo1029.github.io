<h1>Aydan Araujo</h1>
<p>Computer Science Student at the University of Florida</p>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
I’m a computer science student with a strong interest in software development
and building projects that combine logic, problem-solving, and user interaction.
I enjoy turning ideas into working applications and learning new technologies
through hands-on projects rather than just coursework.
</p>
<p>
My experience includes building games and educational tools using C++, Python,
and web technologies, with a focus on clean code, object-oriented design,
and continuously improving my technical skills.
</p>
  
<h2>Projects</h2>

<h3>Minesweeper (C++)</h3>
<p>
A fully functional desktop version of Minesweeper built in C++ using the SFML
graphics library. The project features object-oriented design, dynamic board
generation, configurable game settings, and multiple windows including a game
screen and leaderboard.
</p>
<p>
This project strengthened my understanding of class design, event handling,
file I/O, and managing game state in a larger codebase.

<h3>Sudoku Solver (Python)</h3>
<p>
A Python-based Sudoku solver that uses algorithmic logic to automatically solve
valid Sudoku boards. The program applies backtracking and constraint checking to
systematically explore solutions and ensure correctness.
</p>
<p>
This project reinforced my understanding of recursion, algorithm design, and
problem-solving, while also improving my ability to write clear and maintainable
Python code.

<h3>School of Poker</h3>
<p>
An educational web-based platform designed to teach users the fundamentals of
poker, starting with basic rules and hand rankings and expanding into strategy
concepts. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is actively
being developed and expanded.
</p>
<p>
Through this project, I am gaining experience in front-end web development,
structuring scalable content, and designing an application with long-term growth
in mind.
