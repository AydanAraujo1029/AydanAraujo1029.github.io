      <div class="card">
       <p>
        I’m a computer science student who enjoys building interactive software that
        combines logical problem-solving with clean, intuitive user experiences.
        I’m especially interested in turning abstract ideas into working applications,
        whether that’s through games, algorithms, or web-based tools.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Through personal and academic projects, I’ve worked with C++, Python, and modern
        web technologies, focusing on object-oriented design, readable code, and
        understanding how systems behave as they grow in complexity. I learn best by
        building things end-to-end and iterating on them over time.

        <p>
          A fully functional desktop version of Minesweeper built in C++ using SFML.
          Features dynamic board generation, configurable settings, and multiple windows
          including a game screen and leaderboard.
        </p>
        <p>
          Strengthened my understanding of class design, event handling, file I/O, and
          managing game state in a larger codebase.
