      <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
      <div class="card">
       <p>
        I’m a computer science student who enjoys building interactive software that
        combines logical problem-solving with clean, intuitive user experiences.
        I’m especially interested in turning abstract ideas into working applications,
        whether that’s through games, algorithms, or web-based tools.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Through personal and academic projects, I’ve worked with C++, Python, and modern
        web technologies, focusing on object-oriented design, readable code, and
        understanding how systems behave as they grow in complexity. I learn best by
        building things end-to-end and iterating on them over time.

        </div>
        <p>
        A full desktop implementation of the classic Minesweeper game built in C++ using
        the SFML graphics library. The project includes dynamic board generation,
        configurable game settings, real-time user interaction, and a persistent
        leaderboard system.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        This project emphasized object-oriented design, event-driven programming, and
        managing shared game state across multiple components. I also worked extensively
        with file I/O and asset management to support game configuration and persistence.

        <h3>Sudoku Game & Solver</h3>

          <span class="badge">Backtracking</span>
        </div>
        <p>
        An interactive Sudoku game built with Python and pygame that allows users to play,
        sketch numbers, and validate moves in real time. The project also includes
        automated solving logic that can compute solutions to valid boards.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The solver uses recursive backtracking and constraint checking to efficiently
        explore possible solutions. Building this project strengthened my understanding
        of recursion, algorithmic problem-solving, and coordinating graphical interfaces
        with underlying logic.

        <p>
        An educational web platform designed to teach the fundamentals of poker through
        clear explanations, structured lessons, and interactive navigation. The site
        covers core concepts such as rules, hand rankings, and basic strategy, with room
        to expand into more advanced topics.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        This project has helped me develop front-end skills using HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript, while also thinking about content structure, user flow, and
        maintainability as the project grows.
